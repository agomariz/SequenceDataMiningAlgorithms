# SequenceDataMiningAlgorithms
Implementation of some of the best known Sequence Pattern Mining algorithms that are part of the complete framework SPMF [http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/)
Here you can find all the implementations with which I have collaborated with such framework. For a broader set of algorithms and further details please go, read and download the complete framework at [http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/)
